Learn Type Inference
====================

This repository will contain a set of Haskell programs and related material to
teach you how to build type inference algorithms. We start with basic
Hindley-Milner and work our way to dependent types.

Only a basic background in computer science is required. The examples gradually
increase in complexity.
