Hindley-Milner Type Inference
=============================

This directory contains a sample program implementing Hindley-Milner type
inference for a toy language.

The Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm is one of the most widely-used and
easier to understand type inference algorithms. It was first discovered by J.
Roger Hindley in his 1969 paper _The Principal Type-Scheme of an Object in
Combinatory Logic_ and later opened up to a wider audience in 1982 by Robin
Milner in the paper _Principal type-schemes for functional programs_.

## Running This Program

Make sure you have [Stack][3] installed. Then, run the following command in a
terminal:

```sh
stack exec main
```

This will open up a REPL where you can experiment with the toy language.
